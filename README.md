- 👋 Hi, I’m @SamHastings1066
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning - especially applied to my hobbies: fitness, guitar and salsa/bachata.
- 🌱 I’m learning more about building mobile apps - mainly iOS apps with Swift+UIKit, but also cross platform with Dart+Flutter.
- 💞️ I’m building a mobile-app that uses on-device computer vision models to analyse exercises performed in front of a phone's camera. I'm looking to collaborate with anyone interested in joining in!
